# hangman
Hangman is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. The player is given a limited number of incorrect guesses (often represented by a hangman being slowly "built" as they guess incorrectly), and they must guess the correct word before they run out of guesses and the hangman is complete.
